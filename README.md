# Known issues / improvements

CollectionView warnings
More testing required
DetailView doesn't display fullscreen video (as it used to), this was a design decision, but could be improved by adding a new screen
Better orientation and screen sizes support
Some mechanism to cleanup old cached data
Thumbnails are not looking great with just 100px, it's possible to request bigger images by modifing the URL.
No localisation.
Using URLSession for simplicity, but Alamofire could be useful on a bigger scale project, with better testing as well.

# iOS Tech Challenge

Here at ABA we love Music and we know our users do it also!.

We want to give them the opportunity to learn English by singing their favourite songs.

Actually we have a current section that we would like to improve and restyle.

Usability is a most for us and we would like to have a fresh user experience.

Feel free to modify anything you think would improve the section.
